## 👁️ What is Apex Wallhack ESP?

Wallhack, aka ESP (Extra Sensory Perception), is a cheat that overlays **real-time visuals over enemies, loot, and objects**, even through solid surfaces. In **Apex Legends**, that means seeing:

* Players behind walls or inside buildings
* Loot through crates or containers
* Traps like Caustic gas or Wattson fences
* Deathboxes, ammo, shields, and medkits
* Even third parties approaching from 200m away 👀

This isn’t just about wallhacks – it’s **next-level vision control**.
